    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <div class="container">
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><Span class="Linethrough">Css is not neccesary </Span><span class="Bg-color">CSS saves a lot of work. </span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><span class="underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class="contanier1">
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="Bg-color">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.

    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
